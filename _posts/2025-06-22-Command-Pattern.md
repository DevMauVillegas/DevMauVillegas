Both terms mean taking some concept and turning it into a piece of data (an object) that you can stick in a variable, pass to a function, etc.

Commands are an object-oriented replacement for callbacks.

## Main Code

```cpp
class Command {
	public:
		virtual ~Command() { }
		virtual void execute() = 0;
};
```

Then we create as many subclasses as we need to represent the actions.

```cpp
class JumpCommand : public Command {
	public:
		virtual void execute() { jump(); }
}
```

In our input handler we store a pointer to a command for each needed

```cpp
class InputHandler {
	public:
		void handleInput();
	private:
		Command* buttonX_;
		Command* buttonY_;
}
```

The `InputHandler` class is going to need methods to bind the buttons to each specific command

Then, we can just execute.

```cpp
void InputHandler::handleInput() {
	if (isPressed(BUTTON_X)) buttonX_->execute();
	else if (isPressed(BUTTON_X)) buttonX_->execute();
	else if (isPressed(BUTTON_X)) buttonX_->execute();
	else if (isPressed(BUTTON_X)) buttonX_->execute();
}
```

---

So far we managed to improve the code by making posible the exchange of buttons behavior. But there is more offered by the command pattern.

To make commands undoable, we define another operation that each command class needs to implement.

```cpp
public:
	virtual void undo();
```

This function reverses the game state changed by the corresponding `execute()` method. In order to use the `undo()` function properly, we need to save the game state changed, like a position if moved, a potion name if used, etc.

To let the player undo a move, we keep around the last command executed. When they bang on `Ctrl-Z`, (or whatever) we call those command’s `undo()` method.

---

Supporting multiple levels of undo isn’t much harder. Instead of remembering the last command, we keep a list of them. A linked list where you can move forward or backwards depending if the player pressed `undo()` or `redo()`.

<aside>
💡 Some commands are stateless chinks of pure behavior. In cases like this,k having more than one instance of that class wastes memory.  Flywheight pattern addreses this.

```cpp
class MoveUnitCommand : public Command {

			ThisUnit(NewUnit), Pos_X(X), Pos_Y(Y), Prev_X(0), Prev_Y(0)
			
		virtual void Execte();
		virtual void Undo();
}
```

`[Display the execute() with position]`

```cpp
virtual void execute() {
	// Remember the unit's position before the move so we can restore it.
	Prev_X = ThisUnit->GetPosition().X
	Prev_Y = ThisUnit->GetPosition().Y;
	ThisUnit->moveTo(Pos_X, Pos_Y);
}

virtual void undo() {
	ThisUnit->moveTo(Prev_X, Prev_Y);
}
```

> This example considers a class where we have values to store the position before the execution. To let the player undo a move, we keep around the last command executed.

Title: Game Programming Patterns 101: Understanding the Command Pattern

Introduction:
Hello, fellow game developers! Welcome back to Game Programming Patterns 101. In this video, we're going to dive into the Command design pattern. Before we begin, let's explore two different definitions of the Command pattern and understand how it can benefit our game development.

Definition of Command Pattern:
The Command pattern involves encapsulating a request as an object, allowing us to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. Simply put, it transforms actions into objects, making them more versatile and easier to manage.

Example of the Command Pattern:
Let's start by looking at a practical example. Imagine we have an InputHandler class responsible for handling user inputs. Currently, our code looks like this:

```cpp
cppCopy code
void InputHandler::handleInput()
{
    if (isPressed(BUTTON_X)) jump();
    else if (isPressed(BUTTON_Y)) fireGun();
    else if (isPressed(BUTTON_A)) swapWeapon();
    else if (isPressed(BUTTON_B)) lurchIneffectively();
}
```

Challenges without the Command Pattern:
This approach is inflexible and does not support undo and redo functionalities for user inputs. To overcome these challenges, we'll introduce the Command pattern.

Introducing the Command Class:
The core of the Command pattern is the Command class, an abstract class with a pure virtual function called **`execute()`**. This class acts as the base for all our specific commands.

```cpp
cppCopy code
class Command
{
public:
    virtual ~Command() { }
    virtual void execute() = 0;
};
```

Creating Specific Commands:
Let's create specific commands like JumpCommand that inherit from the Command class and implement their respective **`execute()`** functions.

```cpp
cppCopy code
class JumpCommand : public Command
{
public:
    virtual void execute() override { jump(); }
};
```

Using the Command Pattern:
In the InputHandler class, we store pointers to different commands for each button. This way, we can easily map buttons to specific command classes or allow players to customize their controls.

```cpp
cppCopy code
class InputHandler
{
public:
    void handleInput();

private:
    Command* buttonX_;
    Command* buttonY_;
};
```

Implementing Undo and Redo:
To support undo and redo functionalities, we need to extend the Command class with an additional **`undo()`** function. This function will reverse the state changes made by the corresponding **`execute()`** function.

```cpp
cppCopy code
class Command
{
public:
    virtual ~Command() { }
    virtual void execute() = 0;
    virtual void undo() { }
};
```

Conclusion:
With the Command pattern, we've improved the code by making it more flexible and enabling undo and redo for user inputs. Remember, the Command pattern is incredibly valuable for complex systems with multiple levels of undo and redo functionalities.

Outro:
In the next video, we'll explore the Flyweight pattern, which addresses memory efficiency concerns when dealing with stateless behavior objects. Stay tuned for more exciting insights into Game Programming Patterns!

BIE (Bye in Excitement)!
